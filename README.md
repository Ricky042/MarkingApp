# MarkingApp by Group 79

Welcome to the MarkingApp repository!
This repository is a documentation of all stages of development for the application for Deakin University lecturer

## What you need to do:
- Install requirements
- Split terminal
- Run the starter commands for front and backend at the same time

  ```bash
  cd frontend
  npm start # This starts the frontend stuff
  cd ..
  cd backend
  node server.js # This will start the server storage stuff
  ```
## Extra Notes for Team
- If using VSCode, install some way to view .db files (I'm using SQLite viewer from the built in market thing)
- The database is excluded in the .gitignore for now, it creates a new database on startup, so for now database stuff is local only
- Make sure to install nodejs in the backend folder and react in the frontend folder, not in the main folder part or it won't work
