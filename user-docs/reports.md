# Reports

The **Reports** page lets you review, compare, and export marking data for each assignment.  
It’s designed to give coordinators and instructors a clear overview of how different markers have graded — including their scores, deviations, and comments.

## Overview

The Reports page provides a central place to:
- View all marks submitted by different markers for a specific assignment  
- Compare grading consistency using **deviation** values  
- Read and cross-check individual **comments**  
- Export the final results once all marking is complete  

This makes it easy to identify grading discrepancies and ensure fairness across multiple assessors.

## Viewing a Report

1. Navigate to the **Reports** tab from the sidebar.  
2. Use the dropdown at the top of the page to **select an assignment**.  
3. The report table will automatically populate with:
   - **Marker Name**  
   - **Criterion**  
   - **Mark Awarded**  
   - **Deviation** (difference from the average)  
   - **Comment Summary**

---

## Understanding Deviation

- **Deviation** shows how far a marker’s score is from the group average for each student.  
- High deviations highlight possible inconsistencies in marking that might need review.  

*A deviation near 0 means the marker’s grading is in line with the overall average.*

## Reviewing Comments

Each marker’s comments are visible alongside their marks.  
Use this section to:
- Check the quality and tone of feedback  
- Identify differences in how markers interpret rubrics  
- Ensure comments meet assessment standards  

You can click on a comment to expand it for easier reading.

## Exporting Results

Once all markers have submitted their marks for the selected assignment:

1. Click **Export Results** in the top-right corner.  
2. Choose your desired format (e.g., `.csv` or `.xlsx`).  
3. The file will include:
   - Student details  
   - Each marker’s marks  
   - Deviation values  
   - Comments  

**Tip:** Exports can be shared directly with moderation teams or used for record keeping.

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can’t I see deviation values yet?**  
A: Deviation is calculated only after at least two markers have submitted results.

**Q: Can I edit marks or comments from this page?**  
A: No — the Reports page is for viewing and exporting only. To make changes, go back to the **Marking** page.
