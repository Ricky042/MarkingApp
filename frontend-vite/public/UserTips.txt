***Dashboard***

The standard of active user is if the user submits a marking in 24 hours.

The meaning of flags open is how many markers haven't finished marking.

Upcoming deadline indicates assignments due within 7 days.

***New Assignment***

Please upload control papers in PDF or DOCX format only.
	While DOC files might work, they can cause formatting glitches.

For best results, we recommend uploading PDF files.
	All files are stored in PDF format, and any DOCX file uploaded will be converted automatically — this may slightly change the layout, especially if the document includes tables or charts.

***Assignments Page***

The status meaning differs between roles:

	Admin: Status shows whether all markers have completed marking.

	Tutor: Status shows whether you personally have finished marking.

Only admins can delete assignments, so the delete button will not appear for tutors.

You can use the search bar to find assignments by course name or course code.

***Teams***

The person who creates a team automatically becomes its admin.

You can invite others to join your team via the Markers page.

Invited members are automatically assigned the tutor role.

***Reports***

Only admins can access reports.

On reports page, admins can leave comments to rubric.

For completed assignments, admins can export it as PDF.
